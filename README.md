The exploration, maintenance, conservation, and planning of water resources in a sustainable way is of great importance for the orderly growth and economic and social development of the regions of Brazil. Today, we have large water reserves, however, that consumption must increasingly be monitored and managed in such a way that it can prove society's quality of life and, the environment or the necessary balance for the recovery of resources.
Whether in the use of large urban centers (potable water/ sewage), rural life and agribusiness, development of cities or industries. The incorrect or even non-existent use of information for proper planning can result in environmental and population damage.
